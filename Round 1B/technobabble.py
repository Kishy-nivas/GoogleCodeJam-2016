def bipartiteMatch(graph):
    '''Find maximum cardinality matching of a bipartite graph (U,V,E).
    The input format is a dictionary mapping members of U to a list
    of their neighbors in V.  The output is a triple (M,A,B) where M is a
    dictionary mapping members of V to their matches in U, A is the part
    of the maximum independent set in U, and B is the part of the MIS in V.
    The same object may occur in both U and V, and is treated as two
    distinct vertices if this happens.'''
